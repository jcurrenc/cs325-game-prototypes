<h2>Starflight</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
My game extends several of the provided examples as well as my own attempt at doing plantary gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
I tried to use vectors to simulate the gravity of the planets combined with the acceleration of the rocket to create a fun environment.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The arcade physics engine is very versatile, you can do a lot of what yoou envsion, but it won't be easy.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part is trying to fine tune the planetary physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The assests were source from free resources found online.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Starfight is a game where players will harness the power of the surrounding planets to collect the stars flying around.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game uses keyboard for input. The stars are randowmly generated and have random accelerations added to them in order to keep the game lively.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating how well a simulated gravity system could function to create a fun game focused on player motor skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to enjoy the experience of learning how to finely control their spaceship to catch all of the stars in a stylish fashion.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can navigate using the spaceship using the arrow keys on their keyboard to collecter the stars around the environment. The challenge comes from having to correct the ship's path while the planets are pulling on it with their gravity. The stars also
move somewhat randowmly to keep the game somewhat exciting. In general players should be able to have fun slingshotting their ship around with the planets gravity to catch the stars.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will need to get good at slingshooting themselves around planets to reach their goals.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I want to reach people who have fun playing around in games with fun physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1-3 minutes
</li>
