<h2>CAT-ASTROPHE</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is different from the game that inspired it by also adding falling obstacles as a random element.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game uses Arcade physics and animations to give the player the sense that they are falling.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that putting together sprite animations is time consuming, I wasn't able to get mine into the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made about half the sprites and the other half are listed below.
<ul>
<li>Cat sprite: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/cat-dog-free-sprites">Cat Sprites</a></li>
    <li>Jump sound: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-jump-1">Jump sound</a></li>
    <li>Cat meow: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/meow">Cat meow</a></li>
    <li>Music: <a href="https://youtu.be/P0bpK7kPRys">Nyan Cat [Piano Cover]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game was made to resemble a flash game called "Escape" that I played a long time ago.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This is a game where you must survive as long as possible by jumping around and avoiding threats.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    person with lots and lots of cats
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard
    Randomness: a lot of randomness
    Play style: Achiever
    Genre: side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to challenge player's timing and judgement by making the jumps feel satisfying yet challenging.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have a challenging experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can control their character by jumping. They can jump from side to side, must avoid obstacles, and not fall off the screen. THe player has full control of the character in the air and must decide on a safe path before they fall.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You were the normal pet of a crazy cat lady with all of you fellow cats. At least, until she finally snapped even worse. Now she has thrown you and your siblings down a building and you must survive!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'm trying to reach people who enjoy skill-based games that require a lot of timing.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game lasts as long as the player survives.
</li>
